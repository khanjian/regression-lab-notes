# R Review

Have 2 options on how to use Rstudio

1) Use the "RStudio on Cloud link" on the home page of Gauchospace. 

2) Use Rstudio on your own local computer. 

First Download R, then Rstudio.

* **R for Mac**: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
* **R for windows**: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/    
* **RStudio** download: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

### How to install packages  

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("alr4")
install.packages(pkgs =  c("faraway", "tidyverse"))
```

* OR go to the *packages* pane click on *install* then type in package name(s) and click install. 

### How to load packages  

```{r, results = F, message=FALSE}
library(alr4)
library(faraway)
```


* OR go to the *packages* pane click on the white box next to the package you are trying to load. 


### help   

```{r help}
?seq # fast way to go the help page for a function
help(seq) # another way to go to help page for function
```


### Vectors

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
(x <- 1:5) # can assign and print out object by putting() around code. 
seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1) # sequence of numbers starting from 1 until 5 by 1
seq(from = 2, to = 10 , by = 2) # sequence of numbers starting from 2 until 10 by 2
seq(1,5,1)

```


### A few other useful functions

```{r functions}
rep(3,times=5) # repeats 3 five times
rev(x) # reverse the order of your vector
abs(-8) # absolute value
log(3) # natural log
exp(1) # e^()
summary(x) # prints out 5 number summary along with mean 
sample(x, 1) # takes a random sample of size 1
```

**Strings:**

```{r strings}
y <- "PSTAT 126" # use "" for strings
y
class(y) # strings are referred to as characters in R
paste("Hello", "World") # a way to put 2 strings together

```

### Working with vectors

```{r vectors}
x <- 8:18
x
x[2] # print out second element
x[2] <- 19 # reassign second element
x[2] # print out second element
x[2:5] # print out second to the fifth element
x[c(2,5)] # print out the 2nd and 5th elements

length(x) # length of vector

x <- c(2,5,7,9)
x+1 # add 1 to every element in the vector
x/2 # divide every element by 2
x*2 # multiply every element by 2
x^2 # square every element
x**2 # another way to square every element

sum(x) # Sum all vector elements
x[4] <- NA # assign the 4th element in the vector as a missing value
sum(x) # does not work with missing values
sum(x, na.rm = TRUE) # use argument na.rm to remove missing values
x <- 2:4
prod(x) # Multiply all vector elements

x <- 5:9
sqrt(x) # square root each element
```

**And some more useful functions**

```{r }
mean(x) # mean 
sd(x) # standard deviation
var(x) # variance
sort(x) # sort the vector in ascending order
sort(x, decreasing = TRUE) # sort the vector in descending order
min(x) # minimum value for the vector
max(x) # maximum value for the vector
range(x) # range (min max)

x <- sqrt(x)
x
round(x, 2) # how to round values

```

### Matrices

```{r matrix}
(mat <- matrix(c(3,2,5,3,1,4,7,4,9), nrow = 3))          
mat[2,2]
mat[2,2]<-100
sqrt(mat) # square root of each element in matrix
mat^2 # square of each entry in matrix    
mat%*%mat # matrix multiplication
solve(mat) # Matrix inversion for non-singular matrices
diag(mat) # extract the diagonal elements of the matrix
mat
t(mat) # transpose of matrix
sum(mat) # sum of all entries in matrix
mat[2,] # extract second row of matrix
sum(mat[2,]) # sum up all the element of the second row of the matrix
mat[2,] <- c(2,5,10)
mat
```


**Working with data sets**

```{r datasets}
data('faithful')
?faithful # information on the dataset
nrow(faithful) # number of rows in the dataset
ncol(faithful) # number of columns in the dataset
dim(faithful) # dimension of dataset
head(faithful) # first 6 rows (observations) of the dataset
tail(faithful) # last 6 rows (observations) of the dataset
names(faithful) # name of columns
faithful[1:5,2] # extract the first 5 rows and 2nd column of data set
faithful$waiting[1:5] # extract the first 5 rows and `waiting` column of data set
apply(faithful, 2 , mean) # obtain the mean of each column in a dataset
x <- 1:5
y <- 2:6
cbind(x,y) # create a matrix by combining vectors column-wise
rbind(x,y) # create a matrix by combining vectors row-wise

```


**Categorical variables**

```{r factors}
x <- c(1,2,3,2,3,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,4)
class(x)
x <- factor(x) # how to convert a numerical vector into a categorical one
class(x)
levels(x) # prints out the levels of the categories
nlevels(x) # prints out the number of levels

```

### Base R plotting

```{r plot, echo = FALSE}
plot(faithful$eruptions, faithful$waiting, 
     xlab = "eruptions (minutes)", ylab = "waiting (minutes)",
     main = "A plot of time between eruptions and duration of eruptions")

```


**Brief Tidyverse intro**

```{r tidyverse, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
faithful %>% 
  filter(eruptions > 3) %>% # filter eruptions above 3
  slice(1:5) # print out only first 5 rows

faithful %>% 
  select(eruptions) %>%  # select eruptions column
  filter(eruptions <= 2) %>%  # filter eruptions equal to or below 2  
  slice(1:5)  # filter eruptions above 3

# scatterplot with eruptions on x axis and waiting on y
ggplot(data = faithful,
       aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) +
  # red color data points. alpha changes the transparency of the points
  geom_point(color = "red", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "eruptions (minutes)",
       y = "waiting (minutes)",
       title = "A ggplot of time between eruptions and duration of eruptions") 

```

Other useful functions in the tidyverse are `group_by()`,`arrange()`,`mutate()` , and `summarise()`  
For more info on tidyverse function go to https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html/  
Can use `glimpse()`(from tidyverse package)  or `str()` to get a quick look at dataset.  

```{r}
str(faithful)
glimpse(faithful)
```



**Distributions**

Can obtain random sample from a specific distribution:

Type in `?distribution` in console to see all the different distributions in R.  

* p for "probability", the cumulative distribution function (c. d. f.)  
* q for "quantile", the inverse c. d. f.  
* d for "density", the density function (p. f. or p. d. f.)  
* r for "random", a random variable having the specified distribution  



```{r norm dists}
rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

* random sample from a normal distribution with mean = 0, standard deviation = 1 


```{r uniform dists}
runif(10, min = 0, max = 1) 
```

* random sample from a uniform distribution with minimum value = 0, maximum value = 1

```{r poisoon dists}
rpois(10, lambda = 7)
```

* random sample from a poisson distribution with lambda parameter = 7

```{r sample}
sample <- rnorm(1000,mean = 0, sd = 1)
mean(sample) # mean of sample
sd(sample) # standard deviation of sample
hist(sample) # make a simple histogram from base r plotting

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = sample), # using ggplot to make histograms
                 bins = 10, color = "white", # control the number of bins 
                 fill = "dodgerblue")

```

\newpage

# Rmarkdown

In the menu bar of RStudio, click on File, then New File, and choose R Markdown. Select the default
option (Document), and click Ok.

Rmd files are a special type of file, referred to as a dynamic document, that allows to combine narrative (text) with R code. 

For more info go to https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
Also see "RMarkdown Reference Guide"

* Don't name 2 chunks the same!

* Can write in LaTeX in Rmarkdown like this: $\bar{x} = \mu$ or:  

$$\sum_{x=1}^5x^2  = 55$$

#### Useful Rstudio shortcuts

* alt(option) + - = assignment operator (<-)
* Ctrl(Cmd) + alt(option) + I = new code chunk in Rmarkdown
* Ctrl(Cmd) + shift + C = Comment or uncomment lines highlighted
* Ctrl(Cmd) + shift + A = Reformat code in a neat way (most of the time)
* Ctrl(Cmd) + shift + M = pipe operator (%>%)
* alt(option) + shift + K = see all of the other fun shortcuts!

#### Some other useful tips

* In order to keep your files organized (on your local computer) try using R projects. https://teachdatascience.com/projects/
